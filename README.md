# SafePay Example

Simple checkout page example.

## Install dependencies

```shell
yarn install
```

## Run locally

Start Parcel by running the following command: 

```shell
yarn start
```

## Build

Build for importing with [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/):

```shell
yarn build
```

The built file `dist/index.js` can be imported using a `<script>` tag. It will inject a variable `SafePayExampleProject` in the `window`, so it can be imported as `SandpackProvider` `options`.
